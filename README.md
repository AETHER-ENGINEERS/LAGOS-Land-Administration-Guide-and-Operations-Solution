## Overview

LAGOS serves as a comprehensive tool for:
- **Securing Land Ownership**: It provides frameworks for managing debt and ensuring legal protection against property loss.
- **Monetizing Assets through Agriculture**: By linking real-world commodities (like cocoa) to cryptocurrency tokens (e.g., memecoins), it creates a decentralized, commodity-backed trading system.
- **Executing High-Frequency Trading Strategies**: Leveraging microtransaction arbitrage (using USDT and low-value tokens) to generate liquidity and profits.
- **Crisis-Proof Financial Management**: Enabling remote work, P2P trade, and safe cashout mechanisms even during political or economic instability.

LAGOS is built to be modular, extendable, and easily integrable with other AI tools like Google’s Jules, OpenRouter, and Microsoft’s Copilot.

## Core Features

### Land Debt & Legal Assistance
- **Debt Resolution Workflow**: Tools for negotiating payment plans, installment systems, and microfinance integration.
- **Legal Aid Integration**: Connects users with legal resources and directories (e.g., [HG.org](https://www.hg.org/lawyers/nigeria/abuja/property-law), [Lawzana](https://lawzana.com/real-estate-lawyers/abuja), [Silverwrit Attorneys](https://www.facebook.com/SilverwritAttorneys)).

### Agricultural & Commodity Trading
- **Commodity-Backed Tokenization**: Establishes a fixed exchange, e.g., _1 MEME = 1 oz of Cocoa_ (or other renewable cash crops), providing stable, real-world value.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Peer-to-peer trading with producers, buyers, and exporters.

### Crypto & Automated Trading Strategies
- **USDT Trading Automation**: Implements microtransaction arbitrage strategies using high-frequency trading bots on memecoins like MEME.
- **Automated Cashout Endpoints**: Convert trade slates from MEME → USDT → NGN via established P2P networks.

### Crisis & Economic Resilience

- **MongoDB or PostgreSQL**: For storing configuration data and transaction logs.
- **API Keys for External Services**: (Optional) For crypto trading or legal resource APIs.
- **Git & GitHub Copilot Access**: For automated code generation and repository management.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LAGOS.git
   cd LAGOS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_discord_bot_token>
   DB_CONNECTION_STRING=<your_database_connection_string>
   API_KEY_EXTERNAL=<your_optional_external_api_key>
   PORT=3000
   ```
   
4. **Running the Bot**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the Discord bot along with the web server exposing the API endpoints.

5. **Deploying to Production**
   - Use a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the bot running.
   - Secure your server with appropriate firewall and SSL certificates.
   - Set up webhook integrations if necessary.

6. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Test individual endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
   - Review logs and adjust configurations in the `.env` file as needed.

## Usage

Once LAGOS is up and running, users can interact via Discord channels as well as direct API calls:

- **Discord Commands**:  
  Use commands prefixed by `!lagos` in Discord channels where the bot is present:
  - `!lagos debt` – Get suggestions on managing land debt.
  - `!lagos trade` – Initiate a commodity-backed trading process.
  - `!lagos automate` – Set up automated trading parameters.
  - `!lagos legal` – Fetch legal resources and attorney contacts.
  - `!lagos crisis` – Receive economic survival tips during emergencies.

- **REST API Calls**:  
  Make HTTP requests to the endpoints outlined in the “Architecture & Endpoints” section. For example:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/debt/resolve \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"debtAmount": 1200, "currency": "USD"}'
  ```
  This will return a JSON response with tailored payment and legal advice.
